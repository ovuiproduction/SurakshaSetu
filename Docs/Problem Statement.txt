title Current Issue in Fintech Data Sharing

participant User
participant Vendor
participant Bank

== Step 1: Vendor Requests Data ==
Vendor->Bank: Request user data (userId, scope)

note over Bank: Authenticate vendor\nCheck generic user consent

== Step 2: Bank Shares Data ==
Bank->Vendor: Send full user profile

note over Vendor: Receives more data than needed\n(e.g., full transaction history, PII)

== Step 3: Data Misuse Risk ==
note over Vendor: Stores or uses data beyond purpose\n(e.g., profiling, reselling)

== Step 4: User Is Unaware ==
User->Bank: What data was shared? Can I revoke?

note over Bank: No real-time tracking,\nno granular control or revocation

== Step 5: No Post-Access Visibility ==
note over Bank: Cannot monitor how data is used\nNo expiry or enforcement
